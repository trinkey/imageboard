# imageboard
its kinda cool i guess

## how to use
assuming you can figure out how to run the server, you can submit images by going to `/submit`, and you can approve images and add tags on the `/admin` page. you can configure the valid admin passwords in the `config.py` file

## todo
- add config setting to change max file size and number of concurrent uploads
- allow changing tags after initially adding the image on the admin page
